# NSGA-II
NSGA is a popular non-domination based genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization. 
It is a very effective algorithm but has been generally criticized for its computational complexity, lack of elitism and for choosing the optimal parameter value for sharing parameter σshare. 
A modified version, NSGA II  was developed, which has a better sorting algorithm , incorporates elitism and no sharing parameter needs to be chosen a priori. 
This is a python implementation of NSGA-II algorithm
